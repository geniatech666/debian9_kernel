Required properties :
- compatible : shall contain:

			"qcom,a53cc-msm8916"

- reg : shall contain base register location and length
	of the APCS region
- #clock-cells : shall contain 1

Example:

	apcs: syscon@b011000 {
		compatible = "qcom,a53cc-msm8916";
		reg = <0x0b011000 0x1000>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};
